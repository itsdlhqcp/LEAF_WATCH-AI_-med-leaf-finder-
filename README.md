## An Android App for Ayurvedic Herb Identification and Classification using Machine Vision

## Objectives

- Develop a system to identify beneficial Ayurvedic plants in Kerala.
- Create a machine learning model with enhanced accuracy.
- Deploy the model in the cloud for data updates and processing.
- Develop an Android application for the leaf identification system.

## Description

This project leverages machine learning and AI techniques to develop an advanced deep learning web application for medicinal plant recognition. Utilizing ResNet-50 and TensorFlow, the application accurately identifies Ayurvedic herbs based on leaf images.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsdlhqcp/LEAF_WATCH-AI_-med-leaf-finder-.git
```

### Install Requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App
Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask application:
```bash
cd LEAF_WATCH-AI_-med-leaf-finder-
python flask_app.py
```
